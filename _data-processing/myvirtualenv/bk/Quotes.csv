But when     the time came, when Gondor's need was dire, they fled vanishing into the     darkness of the mountain. And so Isildur cursed them, never to rest until     they had fulfilled their pledge. Who shall call them from the grey twilight,     the forgotten people? The heir of him to whom the oath they swore.

395,PIPPIN,"Well, I'm taller than you were then.  Though, I'm not likely to grow     anymore, except sideways.   ",The Return of the King 
396,FARAMIR,"It never fitted me either.  Boromir was always the soldier.     ,  They were so alike he and     my father.  Proud, stubborn even, but strong.   ",The Return of the King

402,FARAMIR,My lord Osgiliath is over run.   ,The Return of the King 
403,DENETHOR,Much must be risked in war.    Is there a Captain here who still has the     courage to do his lord's will?   ,The Return of the King 
404,FARAMIR,You wish now that our places had been exchanged.  That I had died and     Boromir had lived.   ,The Return of the King

2103,DENETHOR,Perhaps you come to explain this.  ,The Return of the King 
2104,DENETHOR,Perhaps you have come to tell me why my son is dead. ,The Return of the King 
2105,PIPPIN,Boromir died to save us my kinsman and me. He fell defending us from     many foes. ,The Return of the King 
2106,GANDALF,Pippin. ,The Return of the King 
2107,PIPPIN,"I offer you my service, such as it is in payment of this debt.  ",The Return of the King 
2108,DENETHOR,This is my first command to you. How did you escape and my son did not?     So mighty as man as he was. ,The Return of the King 
2109,PIPPIN,The mightiest man may be slain by one arrow and Boromir was pierced by     many. ,The Return of the King 
2110,GANDALF,Get up! ,The Return of the King 
2111,GANDALF,"My lord, there will be a time to grieve for Boromir but it is not now.     War is coming. The enemy is on your doorstep. As steward, you are charged     with the defence of this city. Where are Gondor's armies? You still have     friends. You are not alone in this fight. Send word to Theoden of Rohan.     Light the beacons. ",The Return of the King 
2112,DENETHOR,"You think you are wise Mithrandir. Yet for all your subtleties you have     not wisdom. Do you think the eyes of the White Tower are blind? I have seen     more than you know. With your left hand you would use me as a shield against     Mordor and with your right you would seek to supplant me. I know who rides     with Theoden of Rohan. Oh yes, word has reached my ears of this Aragorn, son     of Arathorn. And I tell you now. I will not bow to this Ranger from the     North. Last of a ragged house long bereft of Lordship.  ",The Return of the King 
2113,GANDALF,"Authority is not given to you to deny the return of the King, steward. ",The Return of the King

2115,GANDALF,Come! ,The Return of the King 
2116,GANDALF,"All had turned to vain ambition. He would use even his grief as a cloak!     A thousand years this city has stood and now at the whim of a madman it will     fall! And the white tree, the tree of the King will never bloom again. ",The Return of the King 
2117,GANDALF,"A wizard is never late! Frodo Baggins.    , Nor is he early, he arrives precisely when he means     to.       ",The Fellowship of the Ring 
2118,FRODO,Its wonderful to see you Gandalf. ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
2119,GANDALF,You didn't think Id miss your Uncle Bilbo's birthday?     ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
2120,GANDALF,So how is the old rascal? I hear it is going to be a     party of special significance?       ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
2121,FRODO,You know Bilbo he's got the whole place in an uproar. ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
2122,GANDALF,Well that should please him.  ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
2123,FRODO,Half the Shire's been invited.     And the rest of them are turning up anyway.  ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
2124,BILBO VOICEOVER,"And so life in the Shire goes on, very much as it has     this past age. , Full of its own comings and goings with change coming     slowly, if it comes at all. ,For things are made to endure in     the Shire, passing from one generation to the next. There's always been a     Baggins living here under the Hill, in Bag End        ",The Fellowship of the Ring 
2125,BILBO,And there always will be.       ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
2126,FRODO,"To tell you the truth, Bilbo has been acting a bit odd     lately. ,I     mean, more than usual. He's taken to locking himself in his study.    , He spends hours     and hours poring over old maps when he thinks I'm not looking.       ",The Fellowship of the Ring 
2127,BILBO,Where's it gone?       ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
2128,BILBO,Aaaaah.  ,The Fellowship of the Ring

2135,SMEAGOL,We lead them to the winding stair. ,The Return of the King 
2136,GOLLUM,"Yes, the stairs and then? ",The Return of the King 
2137,SMEAGOL,"Up, up, up the stairs we go until we come to the tunnel. ",The Return of the King 
2138,GOLLUM,"And when they go in, there's no coming out. She's always hungry. She     always needs to' feed. She must eat. All she gets is filthy Orcses. ",The Return of the King 
2139,SMEAGOL,"And they doesn't taste very nice, does they Precious? ",The Return of the King 
2140,GOLLUM,"No, not very nice at all, my love. She hungers for sweeter meats.    ,     Hobbit meat. And when she throws away the bones and the empty clothes     , then we will find it. ",The Return of the King 
2141,SMEAGOL,And take it for Meee! ,The Return of the King 
2142,GOLLUM,For us. ,The Return of the King 
2143,SMEAGOL,"Yes, we meant for us! Gollum, gollum. The precious will be ours once the Hobbitses are dead! ",The Return of the King

2151,GANDALF,"We now have but one choice, we must face the long dark of     Moria.  Be on your guard, there are older and fouler things than orcs     in the deep places of the world  ",The Fellowship of the Ring 
2152,GANDALF,"The wealth of Moria is not in gold, or jewels, but Mithril ",The Fellowship of the Ring 
2153,GANDALF,Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings that Thorin gave him ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
2154,GIMLI,Aww that was a Kingly gift ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
2155,GANDALF,"Yes.  I never told him, but its worth was greater than     the value of The Shire!  ",The Fellowship of the Ring

2166,FRODO,We're heading for the Prancing Pony. ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
2167,GATEKEEPR,Hobbits! Four hobbits!  What's more out of     The Shire by your talk!  What business brings you to Bree? ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
2168,FRODO,We wish to at the Inn.  Our business is our own. ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
2169,GATEKEEPER," alright young sir, I     meant no offence. ,My job to ask questions after nightfall. There's talk of strange folk     abroad. Can't be too careful  ",The Fellowship of the Ring 
2170,MAN,Out of the way! Watch where you're walking! ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
2171,FRODO,Excuse me ?  ,The Fellowship of the Ring

2173,HOBBIT,Happy Birthday! ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
2174,BILBO,"Alas, elevnty-one years is far too short a time to live     among such excellent and admirable hobbits.,  I don't know half of you half as well as I     should like and I like less than half of you, half as well as you deserve.    ",The Fellowship of the Ring 
2175,PIPPIN,Why are they still guarding it?  ,The Return of the King 
2176,GANDALF,"They guard it because they have hope. A faint and fading hope that one     day it will flower. That a king will come and this city will be as it once     was before it fell into decay. ,     The old wisdom born out of the west was forsaken. Kings made tombs more     splendid than the houses of the living and counted the old names of their     descent , dearer than the names of their sons.    ,     Childless lords sat in aged halls musing on heraldry or in high, cold towers     asking questions of the stars. And so the people of Gondor fell into ruin.    ,     The line of Kings failed. The white tree withered. The rule of Gondor was     given over to lesser men.",The Return of the King 
2177,PIPPIN,Mordor. ,The Return of the King 
2178,GANDALF,"Yes, there it lies. This city has dwelt ever in the sight of its shadow. ",The Return of the King 
2179,PIPPIN,A storm is coming. ,The Return of the King 
2180,GANDALF,"This is not the weather of the world. This is a device of Sauron's     making. A broil of fume he sends ahead of his host. The Orcs of Mordor have     no love of daylight, so he covers the face of the sun to ease their passage     along the road to war. When the shadow of Mordor reaches this city it will     begin. ",The Return of the King 
2181,PIPPIN,"Well' Minas Tirith' very impressive. ,So where are off to next? ",The Return of the King 
2182,GANDALF,"Oh, it's too late for that Peregrin. There's no leaving this city.    ,     Help must come to us.",The Return of the King 
2183,FRODO,But I know you have something to do with it.       ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
2184,GANDALF,Good gracious me!       ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
2185,FRODO,Before you came along we Bagginses were very well     thought of.       ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
2186,GANDALF,Indeed? ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
2187,FRODO,"We never had any adventures, or did anything     unexpected.       ",The Fellowship of the Ring 
2188,GANDALF,"If you're referring to the incident with the dragon, I     was barely involved. All I did was give your uncle a little nudge out of the     door.       ",The Fellowship of the Ring 
2189,FRODO,"Whatever you did, you've been officially labelled as a     'disturber of the peace.' ",The Fellowship of the Ring

2197,FRODO,No Sam! Leave him alone!  ,The Return of the King 
2198,SAM,I heard it from his own mouth. He means to murder us. ,The Return of the King 
2199,GOLLUM,"Never! Smeagol wouldn't hurt a fly! ,     Aaaagh he is a horrid, fat Hobbit who hates Smeagol and who makes up nasty lies! ",The Return of the King

2204,FRODO,If you scare him off then we are lost! ,The Return of the King 
2205,SAM,I don't care! I can't do it Mr Frodo! I won't wait around for him to     kill us! ,The Return of the King 
2206,FRODO,I'm not sending him away. ,The Return of the King 
2207,SAM,You don't see it do you? He's a villain. ,The Return of the King 
2208,FRODO,We can't do this by ourselves Sam. Not without a guide. I need you on my     side. ,The Return of the King

2213,MERRY,What! ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
2214,PIPPIN,I'm hungry ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
2215,FRODO,There's something down there ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
2216,GANDALF,It's Gollum ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
2217,FRODO,Gollum! ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
2218,GANDALF,He's been following us for three days ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
2219,FRODO,He escaped the dungeons of Barad-D'r! ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
2220,GANDALF,"Escaped ,     or was set loose and now the Ring has drawn him here ,      He won't ever be rid of his need for it.  He hates and loves the Ring,     as he hates and loves himself.  Smeagol's life is a sad story    ,  Yes    , he was once called, before the Ring     found him. Before it drove him mad ",The Fellowship of the Ring 
2221,FRODO,It's a pity Bilbo didnt kill him when he had the chance ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
2222,GANDALF,"Pity ?  It was pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.      Many that live deserve death and many that die, deserve life. Can you give     it to them Frodo ? Do not be too eager to deal out death and judgement Even     the very wise cannot see all ends.  My heart tells me that Gollum has     some part to play, yet for good or ill.... before this is over.     ,     The pity of Bilbo, may rule the fate of many  ",The Fellowship of the Ring 
2223,FRODO,I wish the Ring had never come to me.  I wish none of     this had happened. ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
2224,GANDALF,"So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for     them to decide.  All we have to decide is what to do with the time that     is given to us.  There are other forces at work in this world, Frodo,     besides the will of evil.  Bilbo was meant to find the Ring, in which     case you also were meant to have it and that is an encouraging thought.        Oh! Its that way ",The Fellowship of the Ring 
2225,BARLIMAN,"Good Evening little masters.  What can I do for you ?     If you're looking for accomodation, we've got some nice, cosy hobbit sized     rooms available.  Always proud to cater to the little folk, Mr err... ? ",The Fellowship of the Ring

2255,EOWYN,"I dreamed I saw a great wave climbing over green lands and above the     hills. I stood upon the brink. It was utterly dark in the abyss before my     feet. A light shone behind me but I could not turn ,     I could only stand there, waiting. ",The Return of the King

2274,LEGOLAS," We must move on,     we cannot linger. ",The Fellowship of the Ring 
2275,GANDALF,"      They have taken the Bridge and the second hall.  We have barred the     gates, but cannot hold them for long.  The ground shakes.  Drums    ,     Drums in the deep.

2330,FRODO,What are they ? ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
2331,STRIDER,"They were once men. Great Kings of Men.  The Sauron     the Deciever  gave to them nine rings of power. Blinded by their greed     they took them without question. One by one falling into darkness    ,Now they are slaves to his will. They are     the Nazg'l. Ringwraiths.  Neither living nor dead. At all times they     feel the presence of the Ring , Drawn to the power of the One    , They     will never stop hunting you. ",The Fellowship of the Ring 
2332,FRODO,Where are you taking us ? ,The Fellowship of the Ring

2335,FRODO,"I think a servant of the enemy would look fairer, but feel     fouler. ",The Fellowship of the Ring 
2336,MERRY,He's foul enough  ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
2337,FRODO,We have no choice but to trust him ,The Fellowship of the Ring

2339,GANDALF,He's very fond of you. ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
2340,BILBO,"I know, he'd probably come with me if I asked him to. I     think in his heart Frodo's still in love with the Shire, the woods, the     fields and the little rivers. I am old Gandalf. I know I don't look it, but     I'm beginning to feel it in my heart. , I feel     thin, sort of stretched like butter scraped over too much bread. I need a     holiday, a very long holiday. And I don't expect that I shall return. In     fact, I mean not to.       ",The Fellowship of the Ring 
2341,BILBO,"Old Toby, the finest weed in the Southfarthing. ",The Fellowship of the Ring

2344,GANDALF,And what did you tell him? Speak! ,The Return of the King 
2345,PIPPIN,He asked me my name. I didn't answer. He hurt me! ,The Return of the King 
2346,GANDALF,What did you tell him about Frodo and the Ring?      ,The Return of the King 
2347,GANDALF,There was no lie in Pippin's eyes. A fool but an honest fool he remains.     ,The Return of the King 
2348,GANDALF,"He told Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring. ,We've been strangely fortunate. Pippin saw in the Palantir a glimpse     of the enemy's plan. Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas Tirith.    ",The Return of the King 
2349,GAN DALF,"His defeat at Helm's Deep showed our enemy one thing.    , He knows the Heir of     Elendil has come forth ,     Men are not as weak as he supposed. There is courage still. Strength enough,     perhaps, to challenge him. Sauron fears this. He will not risk the peoples     of Middle Earth uniting under one banner. , He will raze Minas Tirith to the ground    , before he     sees a King return to the throne of men. If the beacons of Gondor are lit     Rohan must be ready for war. ",The Return of the King 
2350,THEODEN,Tell me! Why should we ride to the aid of those who did not come to     ours? What do we owe Gondor? ,The Return of the King

2359,STRIDER, You've     already had it ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
2360,PIPPIN,We've had one yes.  What about second breakfast ? ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
2361,MERRY,Don't think he knows about second breakfast Pippin     ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
2362,PIPPIN,"What about elvenses ? Luncheon, Afternoon Tea, Dinner ?     Supper!  He knows about them, doesnt he ? ",The Fellowship of the Ring 
2363,MERRY,I wouldn't count on it ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
2364,MERRY,Pippin! ,The Fellowship of the Ring 
2365,GANDALF,"They will be. ,     You must come to Minas Tirith by another road. Follow the river. Look to the     black ships. ,     Understand this, things are now in motion that cannot be undone. I ride for     Minas Tirith , and I     wont be going alone. ",The Return of the King

2369,PIPPIN,"I don't know, I can't help it. ",The Return of the King 
2370,MERRY,You never can! ,The Return of the King 
2371,PIPPIN,I'm sorry alright? I won't do it again. ,The Return of the King 
2372,MERRY,Don't you understand? The enemy thinks you have the ring! He is going to     be looking for you Pip. They have to get you out of here. ,The Return of the King 
2373,PIPPIN,"And you? You're coming with me? ,     Merry?  ",The Return of the King 
2374,MERRY,Come on! ,The Return of the King 
2375,PIPPIN,How far is Minas Tirith? ,The Return of the King 
2376,GANDALF,Three days ride as the Nazg'l flies. And you'd better hope we don't have     one of those on our tail. ,The Return of the King 
2377,MERRY,"Here, something for the road.  ",The Return of the King 
2378,PIPPIN,The last of the Longbottom Leaf?  ,The Return of the King

2386,ARAGORN,Merry! ,The Return of the King 
2387,MERRY,"He's always followed me everywhere I went since before we were tweens. I     would get him into the worst sort of trouble but I was always there to get     him out. Now he's gone. , Just     like Frodo and Sam. ",The Return of the King 
2388,ARAGORN,One thing I've learnt about Hobbits: They are a most hardy folk. ,The Return of the King 
2389,MERRY,Foolhardy maybe. He's a Took! ,The Return of the King
